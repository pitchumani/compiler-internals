# GCC Compiler Overview
Retargettable compiler, accepts many high level languages and generates code for many different targets.

## IRs
* AST - abstract syntax tree generated by parser
* GENERIC - Language independent tree like structure (gcc/tree.def)
* Gimple - three-address representation derived from GENERIC by breaking down the expressions
 into tuples of no more than three operands. Gimplifier is the pass which does the conversion.
  - High Gimple - Gimple that is not lowered fully
  - Low Gimple - Control structures are linearized
  - C/C++ frontends converts tree structures into Gimple directly (as per GCCInternals Ch11)
  - dump gimple IR using -fdump-tree-gimple option
  - Used for target independent optimizations (e.g. inlining, constant propagation, tail call elimination,
  redundancy elimination etc)
  - Uses SSA form
* RTL - low level IR Register Transfer Language, Close to machine code. The machine description files (.md)
define the pattern for each instruction that target machine supports.

## CFG
The control flow graph is a data structure that is built on top of IR representations(Gimple or RTL).
It is a directed graph, verties represent the basic blocks and the edges represent the possible control
flow from one basic block to another.
- *Basic Block: Straight line sequence of code that has one entry point and one exit point.*
- *SSA: Static Simple Assignment.*
